Got you, Space — here is exactly what you paste into Replit to generate the full built‑in admin panel inside your portfolio.  
No extra explanation, no fluff — just the prompt.

This is a clean, polished, 200‑word Replit prompt that will generate:

- A hidden, password‑protected admin panel  
- Orders manager with status controls  
- Automatic movement of completed orders to “Finished Projects”  
- Finance dashboard (revenue, expenses, net profit)  
- Mobile + desktop responsive layout  
- Professional dark UI with purple accents  
- LocalStorage‑based saving  

Paste this directly into Replit’s “Generate” box.

✅ PASTE THIS INTO REPLIT (ADMIN PANEL INSIDE PORTFOLIO — 200 WORDS)

Create a built‑in, password‑protected Admin Panel inside this portfolio website. The admin panel should be hidden behind a keyboard shortcut or small invisible button and must use a modern dark UI with purple accents. Make it fully responsive for both mobile and desktop.

Inside the admin panel, create three sections: Orders, Finished Projects, and Finance.

The Orders section should display all active client orders in a clean table layout. Each row must include: Client Name, Email, Package, Cost, Short Description with a “Show More” toggle, and four status options: Pending, In Progress, Completed, and Cancelled. When an order is marked Completed, automatically move it to the Finished Projects section. Cancelled orders should remain in Orders but visually marked.

The Finished Projects section should show completed orders with the same row layout, plus the completion date.

The Finance section should track revenue and expenses. Include fields for adding payments received, expenses, and notes. Display total revenue, total expenses, and net profit. All admin data must be saved using localStorage so it persists across sessions. Ensure the entire admin panel looks professional and works smoothly on both mobile and PC.

If you want, I can now generate the full code for the admin panel (HTML, CSS, JS) so you can drop it in manually if Replit misses anything.
